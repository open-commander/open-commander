# Claude Code Rules

Use `AGENTS.md` as the primary source of truth.

## Must Follow

- CLI-first scaffolding; never hand-write configs.
- Fix all lint errors before commit.


## Style

- Direct, terse communication.
- Use JSDoc for components and functions.
- Simple over complex; explicit over implicit; composition > inheritance; don’t abstract until the third use.
